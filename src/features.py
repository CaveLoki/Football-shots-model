"""
Turns raw player_match_stats rows into a model-ready feature table.

Every feature here is computed strictly from matches BEFORE the row's own
date — a player's form going into a match never includes that match's own
result. This is what makes the later time-based train/test split honest;
getting this wrong (leaking same-match or future data into the features)
is the single most common way sports prediction models look good in
testing and fail in production.
